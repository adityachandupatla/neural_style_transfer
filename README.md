# Neural Style Transfer
<p>This project is all about Art generation using Neural Style Transfer by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">Gatys et al</a>. In this project, neural style transfer algorithm is implemented. Using it, we generate novel artistic images. Most of the algorithms optimize a cost function to get a set of parameter values. In Neural Style Transfer, we'll optimize a cost function to get pixel values!</p><br/>
<p>Neural Style Transfer (NST) is one of the most fun techniques in deep learning. As seen below, it merges two images, namely, a "content" image (C) and a "style" image (S), to create a "generated" image (G). The generated image G combines the "content" of the image C with the "style" of image S.</p>

<p>We'll use the concept of transfer learning, i.e. we will be using a pre-built neural network called <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/practicals/cnn/index.html">VGG network</a>. Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to recognize a variety of low level features (at the earlier layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers). The weights for this pre-built network has been taken from <a href="http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/">this</a> is the corresponding website. This project is implemented as part of the <a href="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/deeplearning_coursera">deeplearning specialization</a> from Coursera.</p><h2>Running the Project</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure you have Python3 installed</li>
  <li>Clone the project to your local machine and open it in one of your favorite IDE's which supports Python code</li>
  <li>Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://pillow.readthedocs.io/">Pillow</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.scipy.org/">Scipy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Please download the pre-built VGG network weights from the previously specified link and place it in this project's pretrained-model folder. The size of the weights of this network is humongous, close to 550MB, and is therefore not checked into Git. If you are unable to find the dataset, please do let me know, so that I can help you find out.</li>
  <li>Pick 2 images, each of size 800 X 600 pixels. One image is the content image, and the other is the style image. Put both these images in the image folder and specify their path in the code. See line 162 and 164.</li>
  <li>Run nst.py</li>
</ul>
If you find any problem deploying the project in your machine, please do let me know.

<h2>Technical Skills</h2>
This project is developed to showcase my following programming abilities:
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Computer Vision based applications</li>
  <li>Transfer learning - Building on top of existing networks such as the VGG network</li>
  <li>Use of high level programming frameworks such as Tensorflow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sublimt Text has been used to program the application. No IDE has been used.</li>
  <li>Command line has been used to interact with the application.</li>
  <li>The project has been tested on Python3 version: 3.6.1.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Working</h2>
<p>Architectural Diagram:<br/><img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/images/NST.png" /></p>
<p>We will build the NST algorithm in three steps:
  <ul>
    <li>Build the content cost function <br/><img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/images/content_cost_function.png" /></li>
    <li>Build the style cost function <br/><img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/images/style_cost_function.png" /></li>
    <li>Put them together <br/><img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/images/combined_cost_function.png" /></li>
  </ul>
Here,  nH,nW  and  nC  are the height, width and number of channels of the hidden layer we have chosen, and appear in a normalization term in the cost.
</p><br/>

<p>The generated images are saved in the output folder. You can see the following example for inspiration:<br/>

<h3>Content image</h3> <img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/images/my_goa_image.jpg"  width="400" height="300" />(This is an image of mine, from Goa trip!)
<h3>Style image</h3> <p>(Taken from <a href="https://fineartamerica.com/featured/2-art-abstract-work-odon-czintos.html">here</a>)</p><img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/images/abstract-work-odon-czintos.jpg" width="400" height="300" />
<h3>Generated image</h3> <img src="https://github.com/adityachandupatla/neural_style_transfer/blob/master/output/generated_image.jpg" width="400" height="300" />
<h3>Intermediate images</h3><p>This is what the algorithm does during the intermediate steps. It took close to close 1 hour for running 200 iterations in order to generate the final image!</p><br/>
